explanation: "
Sony gets a high rank in our listing of toxic Android vendors as historically it was Sony who introduced the first very effective non-standard background process optimization and opened the Pandora's box.


It is called **Stamina mode** and it instantly breaks all background processes and all alarms if enabled.
"
user_solution: "
Never use Stamina mode if you want your phone to do something useful when you are not actively using it.


Try to make your app not battery optimized in *Phone settings > Battery > Three dots in the top right corner > Battery optimisation > Apps > your app*."

developer_solution: "No solution so far, there isn't even an API to find out if the phone is in Stamina mode"
