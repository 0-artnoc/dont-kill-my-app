explanation: "
Sony gets a high rank in our listing of toxic Android vendors as historically it was Sonay which introduce the first very effective non-standard background process optimization and opened the pandora's box.

It is called the *Stamina mode** and it instantly breaks all background processing and all alarms if enebaled.   
"
user_solution: "
Never use stamina mode, if you want your phone to do something use-full when you are not using it.

Try to make your app not battery optimized in **Phone settings > Battery > Three dots in the top right corner > Battery optimisation > Apps > your app**."

developer_solution: "No solution so far, there isn't even an API to find out the phone is in Stamina mode"
