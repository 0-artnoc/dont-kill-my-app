user_solution: '

* Go to *Phone Assistant / Manager > Battery >* turn off *Eco Mode*.

* Go back and go to *Manual mode*

* Tap on the *Gear icon* on top right *> Background apps whitelist >* Now select *Your app*


#### Alternatively:

Go to dialer and put the code `*#*#86569726#*#*` and uncheck *Lowram Enable* And *Background enable*.<br>
**NOTE**: this needs to be done again after reboot.
