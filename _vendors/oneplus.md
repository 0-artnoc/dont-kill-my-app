explanation: "OnePlus and their Oxygen OS Android modification is known as maximizing the stock Android experience. This may be true on the UX front but the exact opposite is valid for background process limits.


When releasing their 1+5 and 1+6 phones OnePlus did introduce the most severe background limits on the market to date. Dwarfing even those performed by Xiaomi or Huawei. Not only need users enable extra settings to make there apps work properly but those settings even get reset with firmware update so that apps break again a users are required to reeneable those settings on regular basis.

user_solution: 'Turn off **System Settings > Apps > Gear Icon > Special Access > Battery Optimization**.

> WARNING: Recently OnePlus phones started reverting this setting randomly for random apps. So you set it to be **not optimized**, and the next day it may be back to **optimized**. There is no workaround and you may have to check system settings every once in a while.<br>See [a bug report filed to OnePlus](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/in-battery-optimisation-apps-are-getting-automatically-switched-from-not-optimised-to-optimised.849162/).


On some OnePlus phones there is also a thing called App Auto-Launch which essentially prevents apps working in the background. Please disable it for your app.

Also try:

**Phone settings > Battery > Battery optimization** and switch to the All apps list **(Top menu) > Your app > Donâ€™t optimize**

> NOTE: Some of our users indicated that you need to disable Doze mode in Developer options in 1+3 and earlier.

Also disable **Settings > Battery > Battery optimization > (three dots) > Enhanced optimization**. This option may also be called **Advanced optimisation**.
