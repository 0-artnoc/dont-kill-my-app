user_solution: 'Turn off <b>System Settings > Apps > Gear Icon > Special Access > Battery Optimization</b>.<br>
WARNING: Recently OnePlus phones started reverting this setting randomly for random apps. So you set it to be “not optimized”, and the next day it may be back to “optimized”. There is no workaround and you may have to check system settings every once in a while.
There is <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/in-battery-optimisation-apps-are-getting-automatically-switched-from-not-optimised-to-optimised.849162/">a bug report filed to OnePlus</a>.

On some OnePlus phones there is also a thing called App Auto-Launch which essentially prevents apps working in the background. Please disable it for [your app].

Also do:

Phone settings > Battery > Battery optimization > switch to the All apps list (Top menu) > Sleep > Don’t optimize

NOTE: Some of our users indicated that you need to disable Doze mode in Developer options.

Also disable Settings > Battery > Battery optimization > (three dots) > Enhanced optimization. This option may also be called Advanced optimisation.'
